// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "David Blaine"];
function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    return magicians.map(magician => `${magician} The Great!`);
}
function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    magicians.forEach(magician => console.log(magician));
}
magicians = make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
